The Boulder Opal Toolkits provide convenience nodes, classes, and functions that can
simplify developing and deploying workflows in Boulder Opal.

The toolkits are built on top of the existing Boulder Opal functions_ and graph operations_, and
are designed for a particular physical system, or system-agnostic tasks. For example,
the superconducting toolkit contains functionalities to simulate and optimize superconducting
qubit systems, and the pulse library provides various forms of commonly used control signals.

Each toolkit provides convenience functions, which can be accessed through its corresponding
namespace from the :py:obj:`~qctrl.Qctrl` object. For example, all functions in the utility toolkit
live in the namespace of `utils` of the :py:obj:`~qctrl.Qctrl` object. For ease of use,
some toolkits also define classes for creating abstractions for the physical system.
For example, the `Cavity` class in the superconducting toolkit. These classes also live
in the corresponding `superconducting` namespace of the :py:obj:`~qctrl.Qctrl` object.

Finally, toolkits may also host convenience graph nodes, which can be used together with other
nodes_ for defining a general computation graph for your task. These operations
live in the corresponding namespace of a :py:obj:`~qctrl.graphs.Graph` object.
For example, you can access the nodes for defining pulses from the `pulses` namespace of
a :py:obj:`~qctrl.graphs.Graph` object.
